# Current progress

Team started working Sep 2017.

So far we've developed:

- dataset of task / code pairs,
- a machine learning pipeline,
- several neural network architectures
- software architecture and ready-to-use code to conduct training and
  task execution in a distributed fashion. 

Currently our pipeline produces, on average, give 66% correct answers.
