# Current progress

The team started to work in Sep 2017.

So far we've developed:  

- a dataset of task/code pairs,
- a machine learning pipeline,
- several neural network architectures,
- software architecture and ready-to-use code to conduct training 
and task execution in a distributed fashion. 

Our pipeline produces, on average, 66% correct answers.
