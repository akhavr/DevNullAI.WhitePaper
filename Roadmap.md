# Challenges

To achieve industrial level quality, we need to increase our dataset by
several orders of magnitude.  Also, existing NN architectures do not provide
enough accuracy, so we have to launch a wide exploration of a space of
potential architectures.

This would require amount of GPU/TPU power that's far beyound the reach
of our small research team.

# Roadmap

To solve these challenges, we are planning to do an early launch of an
ecosystem, where we can bring together:

- software developers, wanting to try a new tool in their toolkit,
- owners of GPU who want to help research, and
- deep learning practitioners

To incentivise each party we're launching an ERC20 token on the Ethereum
network.


- open ecosystem and other NN providers
- distributed decentralized uncensorable network
- starting off with a federated solution and moving towards decentralized where AI and data providers can keep their parts private (encrypted)
