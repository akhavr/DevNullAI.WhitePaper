# Challenges

To achieve industrial level quality, we need to increase our dataset by
several orders of magnitude.  Also, existing NN architectures do not provide
enough accuracy, so we have to launch a wide exploration of a space of
potential architectures.

This would require amount of GPU/TPU power that's far beyound the reach
of our small research team.

Also we acknowledge our limited knowledge and don't expect to provide
the best and the only AI for developer's tasks.  Instead we strive to
onboard best teams to provide the best solutions possible.

# Roadmap

To solve these challenges, we are planning to do an early launch of an
ecosystem, where we can bring together:

- software developers, wanting to try a new tool in their toolkit,
- owners of GPU who want to help research, and
- deep learning practitioners

To incentivise each party we're launching an ERC20 token on the Ethereum
network.

We will start by deploying a federated distributed deep learning system,
where GPU providers would be required to post a collateral and earn rewards
for performing deep learning tasks.

Later, we plan to focus on developing and deploying a homomorphic encryption
module for deep learning, so both AI and data providers can keep their parts
private (encrypted).

Since this is mostly R&D, we can't provide any expected launch dates.  We would
deploy updates as soon as they will be available in a quality shape.
