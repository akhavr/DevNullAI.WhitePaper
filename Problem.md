# Problem.

Developers are hard to find, hire, and keep.

Great developers are extremely hard to find, hire, and keep.

Thus itâ€™s hard to scale software development teams horizontally
(increase count) and almost impossible to scale them vertically (skill-wise).

# Solution.

We are going to create AI that would serve a software developer role.

It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English),
tracking system comments, and code.

The solution would be deployed in a censorship-resistant decentralized way
and will be openly accessible to anyone, who's able to pay for its services.

The Dev AI would learn as it goes, acquiring more skills (see the challenge
of growing vertically above).  Users would be able to request as much service,
as they're willing to pay (see above the challenge to scale the team
horizontally, countwise)
