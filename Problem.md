# Problem

Software development is a team game, but it's difficult to gather a great team.

Developers are hard to find, hard to hire, and hard to keep. Great developers 
are extremely hard to find, hire, and keep. Thus it's hard to scale 
software development teams horizontally (increase count) and almost impossible 
to scale them vertically (skill-wise).

Software development process includes a lot of dull routine tasks, but good 
software developer prefers to do only interesting ones. A good software 
developer is irreplaceable, but as a human being he (or she) can be ill, 
tired, depressed, or burned out. He (or she) can even be on the vacation, 
for God's sake. And then you'll remember that tests, documentation 
and other forms of knowledge sharing are typical examples of uninteresting 
routine tasks.

Every person is unreliable in his (or her) own way. It's possible to gather 
a small team of loyal and motivated developers, but difficult to expand it 
keeping an acceptable level of unreliability. 

So we have our challenge. To solve our big interesting problems, we need 
a team of superb players with unique talents focused on performing difficult 
non-standard tasks. At the same time, we have a lot of routine tasks. 
We need a simple way for our team to grow with our business and offer 
an urgent response for emergencies.

And there is no place on God's green Earth with enough people to solve 
all our problems.


# Solution

To liberate developers from routine tasks and make any software development 
team 100% scalable and reliable, we will create AI that will perform 
a software developer role.

It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English), 
comments tracking system, and code.

The solution will be deployed in a censorship-resistant decentralized way 
and will be accessible to anyone who can pay for its services.

The Dev AI will learn as it goes, gaining more skills (the challenge 
of growing vertically). Users can request as much service as they're willing 
to pay for (the challenge of scaling the team horizontally).
