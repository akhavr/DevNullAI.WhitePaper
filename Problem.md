# Problem

Software development is a team game, but it's hard to gather
really good team.

Developers are hard to find, hard to hire, and hard to keep.
Great developers are extremely hard to find, hire, and keep.
Thus itâ€™s hard to scale software development teams horizontally
(increase count) and almost impossible to scale them vertically (skill-wise).

Software development process includes a lot of dull routine tasks,
but good software developer prefers to perform only interesting ones.
Good software developer is irreplaceable, but as a human being he (or she)
can be ill, tired, depressed, or burned out. He (or she) can even be
on the vacation, for God's sake. And this is the moment when you'll
remember that tests, documentation and other for of knowledge sharing
are typical examples of uninteresting routine tasks.

Every person is unreliable in his (or her) own way. It's possible
to gather small team of loyal and motivated developers initially, but
it's difficult to expand it keeping acceptable level of unreliability.
That's human nature, and we cannot change it.

So we have our challenge. In order to solve our big interesting problems we
need a team of really good players with unique talents who are focused on
performing really difficult non-standard tasks. At the same time
we have a lot of routine tasks to be solved by somebody, we need a simple way
to scale our team simultaneously with scaling our business and provide
urgent response for any kind of emergencies.

And there is no place on God's green Earth with enough people to solve all
our problems, is it?


# Solution

In order to liberate developers from routine tasks and make any software
development team 100% scalable and reliable, we are going to create AI
that would serve a software developer role.

It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English),
tracking system comments, and code.

The solution would be deployed in a censorship-resistant decentralized way
and will be openly accessible to anyone, who's able to pay for its services.

The Dev AI would learn as it goes, acquiring more skills (see the challenge
of growing vertically above). Users would be able to request as much service,
as they're willing to pay (see above the challenge to scale the team
horizontally, countwise).
