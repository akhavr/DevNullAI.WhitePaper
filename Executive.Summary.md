# Executive Summary

## Purpose

To create decentralized autonomous intelligent agent specialized in custom
software development and available for hire for everybody.

## Problem

Developers are hard to find, hire, and keep.

Great developers are extremely hard to find, hire, and keep.

Thus itâ€™s hard to scale software development teams horizontally (increase count)
and almost impossible to scale them vertically (skill-wise).

## Solution

We are going to create AI that would serve a software developer role.
It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English),
tracking system comments, and code.

## Competitive advantage

Known competitors approach the task either from pure Deep Learning perspective
(end-to-end learning), or from neurophysiological/NLP/knowledge management
point of view.

First approach is mere brute force and requires huge computational resources
and datasets.  Generated solutions would likely be non-interpretable.
Second approach is non-differentiable, thus requiring lots of manual labour
to maintain and update.

On the other hands, founder has 18 year experience of managing distributed
software developers, that are mostly uncooperative, non-qualified, and
simply lazy.  Due to daily root cause analysis and AARs, founders developed
unique and detailed software development process, that could be transferred
to existing deep learning methods.

## Current status

Public proof of concept to be released during 2018q2
