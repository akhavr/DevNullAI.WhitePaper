# Executive Summary

## Purpose

To create decentralized autonomous intelligent agent specialized 
in custom software development and available for employment for everybody.

## Problem

Developers are hard to find, hire, and keep.

Great developers are extremely hard to find, hire, and keep.

Thus itâ€™s hard to scale software development teams horizontally 
(increase count) and almost impossible to scale them vertically (skill-wise).

## Solution

We will create AI agent that will play a role of a software developer.
It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English), 
comments tracking system, and code.

## Competitive advantage

Known competitors approach the task either from pure deep learning perspective 
(end-to-end learning) or from neurophysiological/NLP/knowledge management 
point of view.

The first approach is based on the brute force. It requires huge computational 
resources and datasets.  Generated solutions are likely to be 
non-interpretable.

The second approach is non-differentiable, thus requiring lots of manual 
labor to support and update.

On the other hand, the DevNull.AI founder has an 18-years experience 
of managing distributed software developers, who are often uncooperative, 
non-qualified, and simply lazy. Due to daily root cause analysis and AARs, 
he developed a unique and detailed software development process, that can be 
transferred to existing deep learning methods.

## Current status

Public proof of concept to be released during 2018q2.
