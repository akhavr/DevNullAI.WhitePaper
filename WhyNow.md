# Why Now

Automated programming was a Holy Grail of the industry for decades.  
Alas, the progress was not that magnificent.

But recently, there was a breakthrough.  Several, actually:  

1. Widespread implementation of cheap GPU for scientific research.
2. Big advances in Deep Learning: achievements of better-than-human 
results in image classification, useful vector representations of words 
and concepts, generative-adversarial networks, etc.
3. Exponential growth of usable data volume.

# Competitive advantage

Known competitors approach the task either from pure Deep Learning 
perspective (end-to-end learning) or from neurophysiological/NLP/knowledge 
management point of view.

The first approach is the mere brute force and requires huge computational 
resources and datasets.  Generated solutions are likely to be 
non-interpretable. The second approach is non-differentiable, thus 
requiring lots of labour to support and update.

On the other hand, the DevNull.AI founder has an 18-years experience 
of managing distributed software developers, who are often uncooperative, 
non-qualified, and simply lazy.  Due to daily root cause analysis 
and [AARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review), 
he developed a unique and detailed software development process that 
can be transferred to existing deep learning methods.
