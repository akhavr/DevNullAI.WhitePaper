# Why Now

Automated programming was a Holy Grail of the industry for decades.  Alas,
the progress was not that magnificient.

But lately there was a breakthrough.  Several, actually:

1. Widespread usage of cheap GPU for scientific research
2. Big advances in Deep Learning: achievements of better-than-human results
in image classification, useful vector representations of words and concepts,
generative-adversarial networks, etc.
3. Amount of actually usable data increasing expotentially.

# Competitive advantage

Known competitors approach the task either from pure Deep Learning perspective
(end-to-end learning), or from neurophysiological/NLP/knowledge management
point of view.

First approach is mere brute force and requires huge computational resources
and datasets.  Generated solutions would likely be non-interpretable.
Second approach is non-differentiable, thus requiring lots of labour
to maintain and update.

On the other hands, founder has 18 year experience of managing distributed
software developers, that are mostly uncooperative, non-qualified, and simply
lazy.  Due to daily root cause analysis and AARs, founders developed unique
and detailed software development process, that could be transferred to
existing deep learning methods.
