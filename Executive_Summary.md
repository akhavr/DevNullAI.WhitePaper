Executive Summary

Purpose

To create decentralized autonomous intelligent agent (AI system) specialized in custom software development and available for hire for everybody.


Solution

We are going to create AI system (or agent) that would serve a software developer role. It will communicate with its human peers via chat (using restricted English), tracking system comments, and code.


On the other hands, founder has 18 year experience of managing distributed software developers, that are mostly uncooperative, non-qualified, and simply lazy ((that are limited by being human-beings with its effects) (and is deeply concerned regarding improving performance and quality of the work experience for developers)). Due to daily root cause analysis and AARs, founders developed unique and detailed software development process, that could be transferred to existing deep learning methods.
